#### Cleaner pre-release Release Notes

From now on if you create multiple pre-releases in a row, the release notes will only include changes since the last pre-release. Once you decide to create a stable release, the release notes will be in comparison to the last stable release.

#### Edit pull request after merging.

You can now edit the message for a pull request after merging by adding a \```rp-commits code block into the pull request body. Learn more in the [Release Notes Guide](https://apricote.github.io/releaser-pleaser/guides/release-notes.html#editing-the-release-notes).
